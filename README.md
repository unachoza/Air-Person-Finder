## Summary

## Future iterations / What I would do better

-Implement sass, I have two annimations that are repetitive. With sass, I can convert them into loops and itterate through
-More Test / Integration tests. I'm still learning tests, currently I've tested a few pure functions. I wrote descriptions for some other tests that I will continue to research

- [ ] Polish

  Time permitting, try to find ways to enhance the experience of the site with loading states, animations, and design enhancements.

- [ ] Responsiveness

  We are purposefully not providing a mobile design because we'd like to see what you can come up with when designs haven't been given. Use your best judgment on how you think the page would respond at smaller sizes. The page should be able to be resized down to `320px` wide without compromising the UX.

- [ ] SEO friendliness

  Use best practice semantic markup and structured data.

- [ ] Accessibility

  Think about screen readers and users with any disabilities. Follow the best practices as set forth and discussed by [The A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/).

- [ ] Performance

  The faster your page loads and performs while using it, the better.

- [ ] Testing

  Tests proving your application works make us happy. Integration tests in particular!

- [ ] Code Structure

  We will be looking at how you structured your React components. We strongly encourage using TypeScript as it helps a new developer (like the person who will be reviewing your code) understand how your components work

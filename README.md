# Summary

Create and deploy a React site based on [this Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/WSfh9nIFwBxmGg4OBVJ5PR/Frontend-Developer-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1). Use the product spec below to understand what you will be building. Your site should be committed to a **public** Github repo and deployed to a publicly accessible URL.

If you are unable to complete everything within **4 hours**, please send whatever you have!

# Product Spec

You're to build a person finder! The page will show a list of people (a name, avatar and description) and the user should be able to scroll the page and down the **entire** list of filtered (if applied) people. On load, the page should be able to scroll the 3000 people.

The search box allows the user to live filter out the list by the `name` property. There are no API calls that need to be made to fetch the data. Use the mock data below and do all of the filtering client-side.

[MOCK_DATA (2).json](<https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/090639df-57c7-4fd7-9472-67e00f8aa05f/MOCK_DATA_(2).json>)

# Deliverables

Once you've finished, please email [Dan Wilt](mailto:dan@air.inc) with the following:

1. A public link to the deployed site
2. A link to the public \*\*Github repo where your code can be reviewed

# Evaluation Criteria

The design you build **must** match the Figma link provided! Please no custom designs. We're looking for pixel perfection! We care more about matching the product spec than any of the other evaluation criteria.

In addition to matching the provided design, your performance will be evaluated based on the following technical areas

- [ ] Polish

  Time permitting, try to find ways to enhance the experience of the site with loading states, animations, and design enhancements.

- [ ] Responsiveness

  We are purposefully not providing a mobile design because we'd like to see what you can come up with when designs haven't been given. Use your best judgment on how you think the page would respond at smaller sizes. The page should be able to be resized down to `320px` wide without compromising the UX.

- [ ] SEO friendliness

  Use best practice semantic markup and structured data.

- [ ] Accessibility

  Think about screen readers and users with any disabilities. Follow the best practices as set forth and discussed by [The A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/).

- [ ] Performance

  The faster your page loads and performs while using it, the better.

- [ ] Testing

  Tests proving your application works make us happy. Integration tests in particular!

- [ ] Code Structure

  We will be looking at how you structured your React components. We strongly encourage using TypeScript as it helps a new developer (like the person who will be reviewing your code) understand how your components work
